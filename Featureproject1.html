          <p>We used html, css, and javascript, and unlike our previous group work, we were asked to use git to build
            the web pages and observe our changes and progress on git. I personally think that git is a good platform,
            not only can it be open source, and it is very easy for my clients to view my website. The design and
            discussion of style sheets is especially critical when doing basic programming. I am very passionate about
            consistency in web design and the importance of improving the user experience.

          <p>Reflection:</p>
          <p>In this project we were given a limited amount of time to complete the project, and if we had more time, we
            would have set
            up more places on the page to utilise js in order to make the process smoother and smoother for the
            customer.
