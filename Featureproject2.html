          <p>This is a project aimed at designing energy-efficient and accessible flashlights for exclusive persona. Our
            group chose the audiences of the elderly and children respectively, and after discussion, we finally decided
            to design and develop the flashlight with children as our target clients.

          </p>
          <p>Reflection:</p>
          <p>In addition, the group also reflected and feedback, in terms of user accessibility I think we did a good
            job, but at the same time, perhaps the size and size of the product as a flashlight is a little too big, and
            needs to be adjusted again later. The consideration of what materials to use and accessibility is important
            in this project. More critical was the author's modelling skills. In the group collaboration, the modelling
            part was mainly done by me, while another team member was responsible for the copywriting and the selection
            of the client group. At the end of the project, we submitted the project by layout through Figma.
            The software utilised in this project are: figma, procreate, photoshop, illustrator, Maya.

      <h3> Brainstroming and sketching </h3>
      <p>
        The project started with a brainstorming session and the construction of design sketches by each member of the
        group. Here's the initial idea of this project, a cat metaphor.

      <h3> Prototyping and developing </h3>
      <p>
        The second step was to use the provided foam board material to cut and sand a prototype of the product for class
        evaluation. This also required human and manual help, and I used various instruments in making my flashlight
        prototype. Since it is designed specifically for children, I chose a soft silicone material for my flashlight,
        while the bulb part uses PVC material to reduce its weight. This kitten flashlight has a tail used as a handle,
        and at its top is a switch to control the power.

      <h3> Finalizing and modelling </h3>
      <p>
        After the prototype was built, we modified it again based on the evaluation in class, and I used 3D modelling
        software-Maya-to make its 3D form. The basic interaction was described by hand at the bottom of the presentation
        so that the user could clearly understand how to use it.
